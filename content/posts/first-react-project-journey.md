Embarking on my first React project was both exciting and daunting. Setting up the environment with Vite felt like a breeze compared to older methods.

The core concepts of components, state (`useState`), and props clicked relatively quickly. However, managing more complex state across components led me down the path of exploring the Context API initially.

### Key Challenges:

*   Understanding the component lifecycle (`useEffect`).
*   Choosing the right styling approach (settled on Tailwind CSS!).
*   Debugging asynchronous operations.

Overall, it was a fantastic learning experience, reinforcing the power and flexibility of React for building modern UIs.
