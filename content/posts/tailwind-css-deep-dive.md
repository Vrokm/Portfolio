Switching to Tailwind CSS felt strange at first. My HTML was getting longer! But soon, the benefits became clear.

No more context-switching between CSS and HTML files constantly. Prototyping speed increased dramatically. The constraints provided by the default theme ensured consistency across the application without much effort.

```javascript
// Example code block
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, Tailwind!");
}
